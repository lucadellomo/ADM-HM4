In exercise 1 I extracted json file and I create a graph G of authors; each link exists if and only if the two authors have at least a common publication and its weight is equal to their Jacard distance.
In exercise 2 I create thwo subgraph; the first one is obtained thanks to a conference given in input and it shows all authors who where there, the second one instead is obtained thanks to an author and a pivot given in input and it rappresents all nodes that have hop distance at most equal to the pivot with the input author. File is a list of dictionaries where each element of the list is actually a publication. I create another dictionary D where there are all authors of publications as key and each value is a list of publications where the corresponding author was. In exercise 1 I create a funciton "js(a,b)" to calculate the Jacard similarity between two authors; then to obtain the Jacard distance I subtract one to Jacard similarity I got. In exercise 2 I calculate the Degree Centrality, where I obtain the node with the high score of degree in the subgraph that I have built thanks to the input conference, and the Closeness Centrality of an input node; in this subgraph not all nodes are connected because it depends from the conference_id that I wrote in input. Then I create another subgraph where there all nodes that has for sure a path with the input author, but I want to limit this linkage with a input pivot that tell me that all authors that have a path bigger then this amount will not be considered in the new subgraph.
